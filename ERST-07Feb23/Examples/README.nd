The directory 'Examples' contains the archives of two real-life data sets, 
on which the package was tested.
Each set contains the four data files "Tree", "Matrix", "Profile" and "Order",
plus 'defaultFilenames.txt', which serves as an example of how these files were 
described during runtime.

To use any of them, extract it and put the full filenames in the corresponding fields in 'File/Input Files'.
Alternatively, you can edit the file and replace the current 'defaultFilenames.txt' with it.
